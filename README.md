# ML_Model_for_Predicting_Ship-s_-Crew
Predicting a Ship's Crew(Regression model)
We build a simple model using the cruise_ship_info.csv data set for predicting a ship's crew size. This project is organized as follows: (a) data proprocessing and variable selection; (b) basic regression model; (c) hyper-parameters tuning; and (d) techniques for dimensionality reduction
